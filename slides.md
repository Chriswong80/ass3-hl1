### The Master Equation
The fundamental relation of thermodynamics:

$$\Delta U = Q - W$$

The work done $W$ is positive when the system expands against an external pressure.

### ANOVA of Part Resistance by Pressure (Machine 1)

We perform an ANOVA to assess if varying pressure has a statistically significant effect on the part resistance for Machine 1. The Upper Specification Limit (USL) for Part Resistance is 10.

**ANOVA Results Interpretation:**
Please refer to the output of the previous R cell for the full ANOVA summary, including the p-value.
*   If the p-value for 'Pressure_Factor' is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), it indicates a statistically significant effect of pressure on part resistance.
*   The boxplot provides a visual representation of the distribution of part resistance at different pressure levels, with the dashed orange line indicating the USL.

### ANOVA of Part Resistance by Temperature (Machine 1)

We perform an ANOVA to assess if varying temperature has a statistically significant effect on the part resistance for Machine 1. The Upper Specification Limit (USL) for Part Resistance is 10.

**ANOVA Results Interpretation:**
Please refer to the output of the previous R cell for the full ANOVA summary, including the p-value.
*   If the p-value for 'Temperature_Factor' is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), it indicates a statistically significant effect of temperature on part resistance.
*   The boxplot provides a visual representation of the distribution of part resistance at different temperature levels, with the dashed orange line indicating the USL.

### ANOVA of Part Resistance by Pressure*Temperature (Machine 1)

We perform an ANOVA to assess if the interaction effect of varying pressure and temperature has a statistically significant effect on the part resistance for Machine 1. The Upper Specification Limit (USL) for Part Resistance is 10.

**ANOVA Results Interpretation:**
Please refer to the output of the previous R cell for the full ANOVA summary, including the p-value for the interaction term.
*   If the p-value for 'Pressure_Factor:Temperature_Factor' is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), it indicates a statistically significant interaction effect of pressure and temperature on part resistance.
*   The boxplot provides a visual representation of the distribution of part resistance at different pressure and temperature combinations, with the dashed orange line indicating the USL.
